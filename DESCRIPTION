Description: KOLaid assists researchers in choosing Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in a network to help disseminate or encourage adoption of an innovation by other network members. Potential KOL teams are evaluated using the ABCDE framework, which considers: (1) the team members' Availability, (2) the Breadth of the team's network coverage, (3) the Cost of recruiting a team of a given size, and (4) the Diversity of the team's members, (5) which are pooled into a single Evaluation score.
